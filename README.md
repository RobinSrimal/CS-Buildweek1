# K-Means-Clustering

The implementation of this Algorithm only uses Numpy and Python. 

  It uses a "Naive Sharding Centroid Initialization Method" to increase computational speed
  by initializing the centroids in a way that makes convergence quicker.

# DBSCAN in Python 

 The implemantion of this algorithm uses Python and the K-D-Tree from sklearn.
